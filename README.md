# OnTheIssuesScraper
OnTheIssuesScraper project that will allow custom scraping of ontheissues.org website.
I am creating this to use for an android app I have that currently just has the text statically embedded
The end goal is to be able to call methods that will take care of all of this work for me, allowing the app to behave in a dynamic way using RESTFUL services
Using the JSOUP library for html parsing
